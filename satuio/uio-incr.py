"""
Script for finding UIO sequences in a Mealy machine. Uses SAT solvers
(in pysat) to search efficiently. The length is incremented each
iteration, so that short UIOs are found fast. It also uses simple
techniques to extend UIOs to more states if an UIO is found. This
can result in UIOs which are longer than the specified bound. For
the usage, please run

  python3 uio-incr.py --help

If you want to read this script, my suggestion is to first read
and understand uio.py. That file is simpler and perhaps better
structured.
