"""
Script for finding UIO sequences in a Mealy machine. Uses SAT solvers
(in pysat) to search efficiently. The length of the sequence is fixed,
but you can specify multiple (or all) states for which an UIO is
desired. When an UIO (of specified length) does not exist, the solver
returns UNSAT. For the usage, please run
  
  python3 uio.py --help
